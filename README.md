# Domain-Driven-Design
**An aggregate** is an encapsulation of entities and value objects (domain objects) which conceptually belong together.

It also contains a set of operations which those **domain objects** can be operated on.

As a concrete example, an aggregate might be a Car, **where the encapsulated domain objects** might be Engine, Wheels, BodyColour and Lights; similarly in the context of manufacturing a car, operations might be: PaintBody, InstallWheel, InstallEngine and InstallLight and Ship.
